# Initial Work Tracking web (Kotlin-JS w/React)

Feel free to explore basic Kotlin-JS way of doing things in React. This simple single-page web contains basic React hooks, sample of own wrapper you can create for an npm library, mobile responsive UI and demonstration of creating your own components.

It also implements serialization and coroutines library that are in use with Firebase Kotlin SDK aimed for KMM projects.

Website will be recreated into more complex web app build with regular React and TypeScript, integrated into KMM monorepo for whole Work Tracking project. For more info visit www.worktrackingapp.com.
